A Step Definition is a small piece of code with a pattern attached to it or in other words a Step Definition is a java method in a class with an annotation above it. An annotation followed by the pattern is used to link the Step Definition to all the matching Steps, and the code is what Cucumber will execute when it sees a Gherkin Step. Cucumber finds the Step Definition file with the help of the Glue code in Cucumber Options.
